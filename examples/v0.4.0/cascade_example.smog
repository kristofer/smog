" v0.4.0 Feature Showcase: Cascading Messages "

" Cascading allows sending multiple messages to the same receiver "
" using semicolons. The cascade returns the receiver, not the last result. "

" Example: Point configuration with cascading "
| point |
point x: 10; y: 20; z: 30; display.

" Benefits of cascading: "
" 1. More concise code "
" 2. Clear intent - all operations on same object "
" 3. Enables fluent interfaces "
" 4. Returns the receiver for further use "
